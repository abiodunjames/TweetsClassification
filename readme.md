### ABSTRACT

Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence concerned with the creation and study of systems that can learn from data. A machine learning system could be trained to distinguish between spam and non-spam (ham) tweets on the Twitter platform. I aim to employ a text categorization technique to classify content on tweets.
